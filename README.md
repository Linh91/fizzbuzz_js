# FizzBuzz js

Learning JavaScript continues with FizzBuzz! 

## Rules of FizzBuzz

- Print the numbers from 1 to 100
- If a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead
- If a number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead
- If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead

## Approach

This was one of the first program I had ever written and was written in Ruby. To get the hang of JavaScript I went back to basics and rewrote the same program but in JavaScript. 

This gave me the crucial understand of how JavaScript worked along with Jasmine testing.
